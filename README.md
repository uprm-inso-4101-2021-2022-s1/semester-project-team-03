# Activity+

## What is Activity+?
The “Activity+” project will consist of creating a platform where users can easily track and update their course progression. This project will be completed by December 1, 2021. The web-based application will allow users to quickly see their upcoming deadlines and update the progress on each of these. Our goal is to help users manage their time so they can start completing all their assignments on time, have time to study for exams, while still having time left over for some me time.  This web-based application will be used by any person who is either a student or a teacher. To be able to use “Activity+” the user will be required to have a stable internet connection. They must also use a desktop or mobile web browser like Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Samsung Internet, Microsoft Bing, Yahoo, or Mozilla Firefox.
